# Introduction to storygraf

Storygraf is a next/react app with an AWS DynamoDB back end. Styling was originally handled through styled components but this conflicted with server side rendering in next, so it was reverted to modules. React bootstrap is used for baseline components.

The site has two functions - a news feed, and a space for users to organize news into tags and aggregate data.

## A news feed

There is a list of "offical" tags that are accessible at /Tags. Think of these as top level folders. These are things like "Sports" or "Technology" or "Politics". As the user clicks on a tag, they move into the next level of tags. For "Sports" there are tags for Football, Baseball, Basketball, etc. This then drills down to teams, etc. At the deeper levels, there are articles within a tag.

For example, there is a Sports > NFL Football > Houston Texans > 2023 Draft tag. In that tag are a series of articles arranged by date that cover the known info on that subject. This series of articles is known as the story graf (graph). Similar tags exist for stories surroinding any given incident or subject. This is the first aspect of Storygraf - showing these stories in a timeline. Users can also add cumulatives and other items.

The second aspect of the news feed is that each time a story is added to a tag, it propagates up to every parent tag. So an article added to the tag above of Sports > NFL Football > Houston Texans > 2023 Draft tag would appear on all of those tags - as long as it is one of the most recent 5 articles.

Users can go to the base graf and see the latest stories for each of the official tag or they can subscribe to the tags of other users. In this manner, users can see the most recent articles for any subject.

## Telling a story

Within any tag, the articles will appear as a timeline. Sometimes, users want to show data instead of just showing a timeline. In this case, users can establish a cumulative for a tag. Cumulatives can then be set for each article. For example, in [this tag](http://localhost:3000/Tag/01GP2JCWM8CDN6GV06BAEJTNBY/01GP4MTAZ5VD19GR60F031YGR7) we show the total number of startups funded by YCombinator. The number in each cycle is shown and the article in question provides this information.

## Organization

There are 4 sections to the storybook for this repo. The first is called "Simple". These are the simplest components - the ones used to build the remainder of the site. These usually consist of one or two divs that may depend upon some inputs and the user.

The second is called "Compound". These are components that are built using the simpler components and React Bootstrap. These are usually combined to make the pages.

The third section are the form elements.

The final section consists of the complete pages.

## Mocking the data

Right now, I am just pasting some request data into the stories. I don't like this and I need to figure out a way to change it so that the stories are not crowded.
