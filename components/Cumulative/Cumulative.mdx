# Cumulative

A cumulative is one of the base items in storygraf. Cumulatives are created in tags and a single tag
can have as many cumulatives as desired. The user then adds articles to that tag and each article can
have one or more of the cumulatives attached to the tag. The article represents a given number for a
cumulative and the total of those items is shown for the tag.

For example, a user can have murders for a year as a tag and then cite multiple articles that each add
a given number of murders. The cumulative total would then be at the top.

The numbers for articles are shown simply as numbers. At the top of the tag, the name of the cumulative
and its total are shown.

The cumulative takes in text for the name of the cumulative, a number, and a color for the background.
