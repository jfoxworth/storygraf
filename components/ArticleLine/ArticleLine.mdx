# ArticleLine

An "ArticleLine" is a component made of several simpler components. The ArticleLine represents one article in a tag. Each article gets a "line" in the timeline. The line contains the date/time, the users inputs, and the title and the description. The cumulatives are also listed.

The ArticleLine is the base unit componet within Storygraf. It is also the most fluid component and has / will change often. We don't have separate storybook pages for each of the components used in an article line because viewing those components outside of the ArticleLine component is meaningless.

If a user is viewing a tag / article which they can edit, they will see buttons allowing them to open the edit modal. This is shown in the second line.
