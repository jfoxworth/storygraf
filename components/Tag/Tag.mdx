# Tag

    This component is the small block that contains the text of the tag and has the background color and text color for the tag.

    Tags are one of the basic building blocks of the site. The user sets the text, the color of the text, and the color of the background via a modal when the tag is created. They can edit those properties later.

    Tags hold articles and children tags.
