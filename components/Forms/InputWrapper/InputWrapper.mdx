# InputWrapper

Storygraf uses react-final-form as a builder for forms. For inputs, selects, etc, we have wrappers that handle errors, labels, etc so that all form elements have the same appearance throughout the site.

The input component has a label that appears above the input, placeholder text, and errors that appear below the input when the meta has errors. I am still working on a method of showing those errors.

<Primary />
<Controls />
<Stories />
