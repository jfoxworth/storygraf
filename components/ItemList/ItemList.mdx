# ItemList

There are two "things" that are displayed in list on storygraf. One is a list of tags. This is handled in a separate component. The second is a list of all other items. An item is usually an article, but it can also be a facebook post, twitter post, youtube video, etc.

This component takes in a list of items. It sorts those items by date and then calls the ArticleLine component for articles, YouTubeLine for videos, etc.
