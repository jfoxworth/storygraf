# FaIcon

Icons are used throughout the site and are brought in from font awesome. They are designed to be as versatile as possible, allowing for different colors, sizes, and no outline, round outline, and square outline.

The samples shown below capture some of this versatility. The only drawback of this is that for an icon to be used, it must be listed in the FaIcon file. The available icons are ...
