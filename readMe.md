## Introduction

This is storygraf. It is a project to provide readers with "stories" where previously only individual articles exist. These stories exist under tags. Users can create these tags and then children tags and/or timelines. Timelines can collect information into cumulative items that further convey information.

## Running locally

To run the project locally, run dev. However, make sure that the back end is running locally or the system is pointed to the deployed version of the back end.

`yarn dev`
